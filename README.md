# FileTLS
FileTLS is a version of [Live Server by Ritwick Dey on Visual Studio Code](https://ritwickdey.github.io/vscode-live-server/), except without an install required. FileTLS uses Service Workers instead.

**If you have access to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), definitly use [Live Server](https://ritwickdey.github.io/vscode-live-server/) instead. Here's why:**

* Live Server has live reload, FileTLS doesn't
* Live Server works offline, FileTLS doesn't
* Live Server supports Service Workers, FileTLS doesn't.
